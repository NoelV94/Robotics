ECE 455 Project 2 :  Noel Varghese (831046371)
The Matlab file included in the folder (Project2Final.m) is a script that performs Forward Kinematics, finds the Jacobian and performs Inverse Kinematics to generate the required joint angles for the Robot arm to move across the 32 points (The m specified in the  trajectory file was modified from 31 to 32  to accomodate the 32 points in the file). The main loop is a "for loop" that runs 32 times (Varies, based on the value of m specified in the trajectory file).

a. If multiple Matlab scripts are used, what is the top-level script? 
   ->  A single Matlab script was used for the entire operation.

b. What was the most difficult part of the project?   
   ->   -

c. How can the project be improved?
   ->   -
