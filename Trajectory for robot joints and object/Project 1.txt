ECE 455 Project 1

The submitted files include matlab scripts for the the robot as well as the object along with the output robot.ang 
and object.traj files.
The robot.m file will read the given .key file and perform hermite interpolation and generate robot.ang file.
The object.m file will read data from the appropriate .key file (object.key in this case), convert the rotation matrix to quaternion, 
perform quaternion interpolation and then convert the interpolated values to a rotation matrix form. Position interpolation is done by
means of Catmull Rom. 


a. If multiple Matlab scripts are used, what is the top-level script? 
   For generating the obeject.traj file, the object.m file is the top level script with the R to Q, Quaternion Interpolation and Q to R scripts
   being used in the top level script. The quaternion to rotation matrix has been slightly modified. 

b. What was the most difficult part of the project? 
   The most difficult part of the project was, understanding the working of Animate and generating the object.traj file
   by means of quaternion and catmull rom interpolation

c. How can the project be improved?
   Additional .key files and examples could have been provided to obtain a better understanding of the working of animate.
